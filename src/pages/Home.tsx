            A Bit About Chris

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Chris Aslan was born in Turkey and spent his childhood there and in war-torn Beirut. After school, Chris spent two years at sea before studying media and journalism at Leicester University.

          He then moved to Khiva, a desert oasis in Uzbekistan, establishing a UNESCO workshop reviving fifteenth century carpet designs and embroideries, and becoming the largest non-government employer in town. He was kicked out as part of an anti-Western purge, and took a year in Cambridge to write A Carpet Ride to Khiva.

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Chris then spent several years in the Pamirs mountains of Tajikistan, training yak herders to comb their yaks for their cashmere-like down. Next came a couple more years in Kyrgyzstan living in the worldâ€™s largest natural walnut forest and establishing a wood-carving workshop.

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Now, Chris bases himself in North Cyprus where he works as a writer, spending part of each year in the UK, lecturing and catching up with friends and family. He still returns to Central Asia whenever he can to lead tours, having left a large chunk of his heart out there.
